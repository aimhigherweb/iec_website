A phoropter is a machine that stores all the range of lenses optometrists use to check your eye. It is a piece of equipment resembling a mask with two eye-holes. These are traditionally operated by hand to rotate different lenses into place.

Innovative Eye Care now has an **_automated_** phoropter in every consulting room. During your eye exam your optometrist will only need to press buttons on a remote control to change to any combination of different lenses. This speeds up the time it takes to work out your prescription leaving more time to thoroughly check the health of your eyes and discuss other aspects of your vision.

The automated phoropter head can also test a range of near vision aspects to ensure your progressives and bifocals give you the appropriate focus for your near tasks.
