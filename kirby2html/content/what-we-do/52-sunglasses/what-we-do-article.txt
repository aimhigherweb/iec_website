Maui Jim sunglasses are designed with brilliant vision in mind. Their philosophy is centred around finding new ways to reveal more of the vibrant colours of the world while protecting your eyes from the effects of harsh glare and harmful rays. Every pair of Maui's can be fitted with your polarised prescription lenses to ensure that you enjoy clear, comfortable vision in a frame that suits your individual personality and lifestyle.

For those who wish to enjoy the convenience of wearing the same pair of glasses for both indoor and outdoor activities, Innovative Eye Care offers [tinted lenses](http://innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/glasses). These stay clear indoors but darken to reduce glare when you walk outside.
