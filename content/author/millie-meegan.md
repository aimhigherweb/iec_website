Millie joined Innovative Eye Care as a therapeutic optometrist after graduating from Flinders University with a Masters of Optometry. Throughout her studies, she worked closely with the optometric team over a period of 5 years in the care of patients at the clinic. She has also thoroughly enjoyed working with underserved communities in recent years.

As a result, she is proficient in managing patients with keratoconus, myopia, glaucoma and dry eye disease as well as soft and rigid contact lens wearers and children. Millie has an interest in all areas within the scope of optometry, but finds cases where standard of living can be improved the most rewarding.
