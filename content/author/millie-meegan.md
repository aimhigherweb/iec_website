Millie joined Innovative Eye Care as a therapeutic optometrist after graduating from Flinders University with a Masters of Optometry. Throughout her studies, she worked closely with the optometric team over a period of 5 years at the clinic in caring for patients. She has also thoroughly enjoyed outreach optometry in recent years, working with Indigenous communities and underserved schools.

She enjoys working with patients to manage their high refractive error, dry eye disease, keratoconus and other corneal ectasia. In particular, she has a keen interest in scleral lenses, as well as corneal RGPs and soft lenses. Millie enjoys working within the full scope of optometry, but finds cases where standard of living can be improved the most rewarding.
