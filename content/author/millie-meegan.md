Millie joined Innovative Eye Care as a therapeutic optometrist after graduating from Flinders University with a Masters of Optometry. Throughout her studies, she worked closely with the optometric team over a period of 5 years at the clinic in caring for patients. She has also thoroughly enjoyed outreach optometry in recent years, working with Indigenous communities and underserved schools.

She is proficient in managing patients with keratoconus, myopia and dry eye disease. She has an interest in contact lenses, both rigid and soft. Millie enjoys working within the full scope of optometry, but finds cases where standard of living can be improved the most rewarding.
