Rui is a therapeutically endorsed optometrist joining Innovative Eye Care after graduating from Flinders University. He has a particular interest in complex contact lenses and myopia control, which arose from his key involvement in working closely with ophthalmologists in China and training them in the clinical practice of orthokeratology.

Rui also has many skills outside of the realm of optometry. He is fluent in both Mandarin and English, and is also a keen swimmer, snowboarder and chess player. He is also involved in the Chinese community within Adelaide and enjoys travelling the world.
