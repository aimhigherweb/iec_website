Karl grew up in Toowoomba in country Queensland and followed his passion for physical sciences directly from school into the Bachelor of Applied Science (Optometry) degree at QUT in Brisbane. Since graduating alongside Lachlan in 2007, Karl has worked in many reputable practices around Australia whilst also acquiring a Graduate Certificate in Ocular Therapeutics.

His keen interested in cycling has seen him race state, national and international cycling events including taking the SA state road championships. He also supports independent media, locally made products where possible, and minimalism.

With an evidence based approach to eye care, Karl is interested in ocular therapeutics, a topic he guest lectures to Flinders optometry students, and general health care. With a partner who is studying medicine, it'd be hard not to! He is also interested in dry eye disorders, inflammatory and infectious eye disease, contact lenses, colour vision, diabetic eye disease and binocular vision disorders.

Karl is a member of Optometry South Australia, Cornea and Contact Lenses Society of South Australia, Amnesty International, Norwood Cycling Club and Cycling Australia.
