Old but young at heart, Peter has worked in optometry for over fifty years. Starting as an optical mechanic, he then moved on to the retail side as an optical dispenser and branch manager at Richmond. Joining the Innovative Eye Care team in 2016 following the merge between Richmond, North Terrace and Innovative optometry practices, Peter enjoys helping patients with their visual needs. When he's not at work, leisure time is spent with his grandchildren and following his Mighty Crows!
