There are certain pairings of things that simply do not mix well together; water and oil, orange juice and toothpaste, scotch and water, bathtubs and toasters, and tap water and contact lenses!

Washing contact lenses in tap water poses an increased risk of a very serious, sight-threatening eye infection. This is caused by a microorganism called acanthamoeba which is found in many sources of water, including tap water, fresh water, spas, pools and even showers.<sup>1, 2</sup> 

These types of infections are painful, difficult to treat and complications can lead to permanent vision loss. 

**What can you do to reduce your risk of an acanthamoeba infection? <sup>1, 2</sup>** 

* DO NOT rinse your contact lenses or your contact lens case with water
* DO NOT store your lenses in water 
* DO NOT swim in your contact lenses 

When wearing contact lenses it is important to always follow the recommended wear and care instructions of your optometrist. Remember to not mix and match solutions or change the recommended disinfecting solutions and always use fresh, unexpired solutions for your lenses. Solutions generally expire 90 days after opening the bottle, so always check the label.

A safe and simple way of cleaning and disinfecting your lenses is with a peroxide cleaner, such as AOSept. <sup>3</sup> Over the course of a 6 hour period the catalyst in the case converts the disinfecting hydrogen peroxide solution into water and oxygen gas, meaning that there is no need to rinse the lenses after!
