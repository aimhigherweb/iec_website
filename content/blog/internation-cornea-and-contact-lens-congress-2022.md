In October 2022, the IEC optometrists team – Millie, Dylan, Lachlan and Pooja – jetted off to Sydney for the International Cornea and Contact Lens Congress.

Lachlan gave a lecture about complex scleral lenses, outlining which patients can benefit the most from these rigid lenses. The talk included research conducted through Innovative Eye Care with our keratoconic patients.

Pooja gave a lecture about orthokeratology lens design to other optometrists, whose experience with these lenses ranged from minimal to experts. She also ran workshops, delivering hands-on knowledge to smaller groups.

It was a great opportunity to learn about the latest and greatest contact lens technology from speakers around the world!
