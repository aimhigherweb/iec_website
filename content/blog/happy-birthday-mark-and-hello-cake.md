We're celebrating Mark Parson's birthday here at Innovative Eye Care. Jane Scotcher has been lovely enough to make us all a cake for the occasion, but we don't want to have all the fun by ourselves! That's why we've got all the instructions you'll need to remake the cake at home - that is, if you'd like to taste the most delicious thing in the world for yourself.

#### Jane's Naked Strawberries & Cream Sponge Cake

You will need:

* 2 unfilled store bought sponge cakes, each cut in half horizontally
* 1 very generous portion of Mrs Appleton's homemade strawberry jam (but good quality store bought is fine!)
* Lashing of thickened cream
* 2 punnets of juicy red ripe strawberries, sliced

To make:

1. Split each sponge cake into two horizontally. Freezing slightly aids in the layering.
2. Spread jam on 3 of the 4 sponge cakes.
3. Cover the same with as many or as little strawberries as desired.
4. Start assembling by spreading a thick layer of cream right to the edges of the same sponge cakes.
5. Cover the top and sides with more cream.
6. Decorate as desired - try strawberries dipped in chocolate or shaved chocolate!
7. Serve.
