We are very excited to show off our new office refurbishment at the Hutt Street premises. This project certainly has been a few years in the making.

Many thanks to Sue Barber at Decor & Design, and her army of professionals for their amazing work (often outside normal trading hours to accommodate our crazy schedule). Also a big thank you to our loyal patients, the Innovative team and the Hutt Street Medical Centre for your patience and understanding throughout the whole process.
