<div> <p>Wrinkles, kinks and waves in vision can be caused by an \*\*epiretinal membrane\*\*, a common condition affecting the macula â€“ the part of the eye that detects light. Usually its effects are subtle, and most people may not notice a problem with their vision.<sup>1</sup> It affects around 1 in 10 people over the age of 40, and its prevalence increases with age.<sup>2</sup></p> </div>

Epiretinal membranes, also known as cellophane maculopathy or macular pucker, are scar tissue formations on the back of the eye. When the scar contracts, it lifts the macula with it. Photoreceptors (cells that are sensitive to light) within the macula are displaced from their usual position, usually in a wrinkled pattern, leading to the perception of wrinkles in vision.

It can occur either spontaneously or secondary to a range of eye conditions including:

* Retinal tears and detachments
* Ocular trauma
* Vascular conditions (diabetes, vein occlusions)
* Uveitis
* Cataract surgery
* Intraocular tumours

Many of these causes are serious. For this reason, wrinkles in vision need to be thoroughly investigated. Optical coherence imaging is the best way to assess and monitor epiretinal membranes.<sup>4</sup> Innovative Eye Care is equipped with highly sensitive equipment which aids in detection of epiretinal membranes and guides management.

Epiretinal membranes do not always require treatment. Typically only about a third of cases worsen, and others can improve spontaneously.<sup>2</sup> If they are significantly affecting vision or associated with other problems at the back of the eye, the membrane can be surgically removed by an Ophthalmologist. This has a high success rate, with 60-90% of patients experiencing improved vision immediately, and some continuing to improve over the next few years.<sup>4,5</sup> This surgery causes cataract, but cataract surgery can be performed at the same time depending on the severity of symptoms.<sup>5</sup>
