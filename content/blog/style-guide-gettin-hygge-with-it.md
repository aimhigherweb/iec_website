<i>Tidying Up with Marie Kondo</i> is a sign of the times. We’re all about conserving space, which most of the time is a good thing. But when it dips into minimalism, it can become an attitude that prevents us from feeling comfortable in our own space. Minimalism would rather an area be pleasing to the eye than functional. With colder weather comes a need to be snug and warm, and a big part of that can be having a packed room to make the space seem smaller. So don’t be surprised that now we’re heading into autumn, you might be feeling a yearning to pull some of your old stuff out of the cupboard.

_Where would you rather be on a cold wintry day – a minimalist open space (left) or a snug nook (right)?_

The Danes have a very Danish word for this particular mood. You might have felt it before when you tucked into a winter roast with family and friends, or when you read a book in your comfiest armchair with a mug of hot chocolate, or when you dozed off under a heavy quilt while it poured outside. “Hygge” (pronounced hue-gah) is the feeling of contentment that comes from being cozy.<sup>1</sup>

It’s a difficult thing to imbue that feeling into physical items. Danish eyewear manufacturer ProDesign has managed to do it. Favouring autumnal colours and basic but striking styles, they embody nature's proclivity for effortless beauty in the changing seasons. Not too risky in terms of hue or style, the ProDesign Danish Heritage collection represents the safety of hygge – happiness from simplicity.
