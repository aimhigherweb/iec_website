<div><p>Macular Month is about reminding us of the importance of eye health, especially inside our eyes. When light enters our eyes through the pupil, it’s focussed on the back of our eye, or the retina. There’s a central and highly sensitive part of the retina called the macula, and it’s this that we use to look at things in the middle of our field of view. The light that falls on the retina is converted into electrical signals and interpreted by our brain. Without it, we wouldn’t see a thing. To have your macula checked, <a href="https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/contact/">contact us</a> to make an appointment or <a href="https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/contact/">book online</a>.</p></div>

In Australia, we are especially susceptible to UV damage.<sup>1</sup> It’s invisible light that enters through the pupil with the rest of the visible spectrum of light making up our world. The problem with UV light is that it does damage to the macula, unlike [visible light](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/blog/blue-light-filters). With enough damage, we can develop conditions like [age-related macular degeneration](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/macular-degeneration), or ARMD.<sup>2</sup> It’s important as we get older to wear [polarised UV sunglasses](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/sunglasses), ensure your regular [glasses](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/glasses) have UV protection and have regular check-ups with your optometrist to check for signs of ARMD. Luckily, ARMD can be managed, and depending on the type it may even be as simple as taking a tablet every day, known as [Macutec](https://eyesolutions.com.au/collections/nutrition/products/macutec-omega-3-economy-pack-120-capsules).<sup>3</sup> Similarly, [cookbooks](https://www.mdfoundation.com.au/content/macula-menu-MM18) have been published by the [Macula Disease Foundation Australia](https://www.mdfoundation.com.au/content/macula-month-2020) to make sure your diet sustains your macular health.

Other conditions unrelated to UV damage can also affect the retina. They might be associated with conditions like [diabetes](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/diabetes-and-the-eye) and high blood pressure, they might be genetic, and some can even occur randomly.<sup>4</sup> It’s incredibly important to have regular check-ups with your optometrist so they can continue to assess the back of your eye and monitor its health. Both our practices at Innovative Eye Care are equipped with state-of-the-art [OCTs](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/oct), which allows us to look through the tissue layers of your eyes for any hidden signs of disease, and both have [fundus photography](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/retinal-photography), letting us detect, identify and monitor issues at the macula. At our Adelaide City practice, we use [OCT-A](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/optical-coherance-tomography-angiography-oct-a), giving us the technology to detect tiny changes in the eye's blood vessels associated with disease before any physical or visual change occurs.
