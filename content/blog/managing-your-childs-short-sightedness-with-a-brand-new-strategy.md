<p>Myopia, or short-sightedness, causes blurry vision either because the eye has grown too long or because its focusing power is too great. The former of these is more worrying, since out-of-control growth stretches and damages the tissues at the back of the eye, which can lead to blindness.<sup>1</sup></p>

Myopia is predicted to affect half of the world’s population by 2050.<sup>2</sup> The surge in numbers is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including parental myopia, spending more time on activities up close (like on electronic devices) and spending less time outdoors.<sup>3</sup>

While we can’t reverse or cure myopia, we can certainly slow down its progression. In the wise words of Henry De Bracton – “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”. Previously, the mainstay treatments for myopia control were atropine eye drops or multifocal contact lenses. While both options are still very effective for controlling myopia, and studies have found children to be some of the safest candidates for contact lens wear<sup>4</sup>,it can still be daunting for some kids.

New research in myopia control has found that a new spectacle lens design known as DIMS (defocus incorporated multiple segments) is also effective in slowing the growth of the eyeball.5DIMS lenses are able to slow the progression of myopia by an average of 60% (for comparison, custom contact lenses and atropine slow myopia anywhere from 60% to 100%).<sup>3</sup> These lenses offer children a non-invasive and easy way to slow down the growth of their eyeball and therefore prevent the development of a greater degree of myopia.

If you’re interested in DIMS technology and would like to make an appointment, please contact our practices.
