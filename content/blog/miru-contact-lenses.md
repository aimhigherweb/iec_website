See the world in a new way with Miru contact lenses. Developed with the latest Japanese technology, the name ‘Miru’, means to see. At Innovative Eye Care we are always on the look-out for the latest and greatest for our patients and have been blown away at the quality, convenience and comfort that Miru contact lenses have to offer.

**Miru 1day Flat Pack**

The Miru flat pack is thoughtfully designed for those of us with busy lifestyles. At barely 1mm thick, the lightweight packaging is easy to store, especially for our avid travellers or for sport!  

This innovative packaging also ensures that the inner surface of the lens remained uncontaminated right up until it is on the eye. Not only is this hygienic, with 3x less bacterial contamination than conventional packaging<sup>1</sup>, there is also the convenience of always having the lens the right side up – every time!

Miru lenses are made to form special biomimetic bonds with your tears, meaning that they are naturally wettable and provide the ultimate comfort. This also means they are less likely to dry out in airconditioned or windy environments or at the end of the day.<sup>2</sup>  

**Miru 1day UpSide**

The unique packaging of Miru 1day UpSide allows for hygienic lens handling, as the inner surface of the lens remains untouched right up until the lens is in the eye. The UpSide cases have a unique smart zone that ensures the inner lens surface is facing downwards, so that the lens is always removed and inserted without the inner surface being contaminated.
