My name is Ashleigh and I am a 5th year optometry student from Flinders University. I have been lucky enough to spend the last 4 weeks on clinical placement at Innovative Eye Care Hutt Street, where I have been mentored by the practices highly skilled and passionate optometrists. During my placement I have seen an array of different eye conditions and the broad range of treatment options that are available.

As an alternative to standard contact lenses, a treatment called Orthokeratology provides vision correction which only requires contact lenses to be worn overnight. This process uses a rigid contact lens that reshapes the front surface on the eye which, when removed the following morning, provides unaided vision correction during the day. I have found it very interesting learning about the process of fitting these lenses and seeing results as soon as the following morning. I’ve also found it fascinating learning about the lenses role in preventing myopia progression in children. As high levels of myopia can increase the risk of pathology at the back of the eye, it has been rewarding to see that some children, who had shown rapidly progressing myopia, have slowed in progression after wearing orthokeratology lenses.

For some eye conditions such as Keratoconus, where the surface of the eye is irregular, there is a great benefit in using rigid contact lenses to correct vision greater than can be achieved in glasses. These can be small corneal lenses or larger scleral lenses. It has been fascinating to learn about the fitting of these lenses and to see the dramatic improvement of vision in those wearing them. This can be life changing for some patients who have previously never been able to achieve good quality vision.
I have particularly enjoyed using the imaging equipment such as the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT. This technology is used to take multicolour and cross-sectional images of the back of the eye and is able to pick up subtle structural changes that may be difficult to detect clinically. It has been really interesting to see how the use of these images helps to determine the tissue in the eye is affected the best management that is required. Using this technology has broadened my knowledge of the anatomy of the eye and my ability to interpret changes that may occur in different pathologies.

During my placement I was also involved with a school screening where we tested the vision and eye function of primary school students. It was particularly rewarding participating in the screening as a number of children were identified as having abnormal vision function and were recommended further testing. Poor vision can have a dramatic effect on a child’s ability to perform well at school and is pleasing to see when parents observe notable changes in a child’s behaviour after correcting their vision.

My time at Innovative Eye Care has been a fantastic learning experience which has greatly expanded my knowledge of eye conditions and treatment options. I am very grateful to the team for sharing their knowledge with me which will very helpful as I progress through my studies and into my optometry career.
