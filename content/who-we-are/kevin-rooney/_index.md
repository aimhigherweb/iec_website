Kevin has been a much loved South Australian Optometrist for the last 44 years. He has unfortunately now departed for retirement. Kevin will be greatly missed by all but will relish the opportunity to spend more time with family and indulge in music, arts and travel. 

Kevin has enjoyed collaborating with Optometrists Lachlan Scott-Hoy and Karl Evans to transfer his extensive knowledge and share his methods in paediatric optometry. He has every confidence the same standard of attentive care will be continued and enhanced with the use of the latest technology.
