Since graduating high school in 2016, Millie has been studying optometry at Flinders University. Raised locally in a family of health practitioners, she has had an interest in the field since she was an ankle-biter.

Her passion for helping others and her unfailing friendliness mean you will always feel at home when you visit Innovative Eye Care. If you like the music playing in the practice, she likely picked the playlist. Unless you donâ€™t like the music, in which case - Jane picked it.
