Dylan is a therapeutically endorsed optometrist who has recently graduated from Flinders University. Before graduating, he was 1 of only 4 recipients of an American Academy of Optometry scholarship for clinical and academic excellence nationwide. This gave him the opportunity to undertake placement at the State University of New York's College of Optometry, as well as at our very own Australian College of Optometry in Victoria.

He is passionate about contact lenses, children's vision and ocular disease management. Outside of the practice, Dylan is a dedicated baseball player for Glenelg Baseball Club and plays trombone in a local jazz band.
