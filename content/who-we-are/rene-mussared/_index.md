Rene has been working with behavioural and independent optometrists since starting her career in optics in 2003. Rene began her time in optics as an administrator but after it being identified that she had a knack for building relationships with the children visiting the practice she was quickly trained to work as a vision therapist and optical assistant. Before joining the team at Innovative Eye Care Rene worked as a vision therapist at North Terrace Optometrists and has worked with hundreds of children, helping them with their visual perceptual skills. Rene is part way through a psychology degree and looks forward to continuing with her studies as her passion for assisting children with learning troubles grows.

When Rene isn't here working with the Children she works as a family and wedding photographer and also owns a busy bridal boutique. You may also hear her singing away in the hallways of our practices as she is a keen singer and song writer.
