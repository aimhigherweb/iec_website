Jane is our Optical Curator and resident 'ray of sunshine'. As an Optical Curator Jane is solely responsible for our fashion-forward, exclusive and quality range of frames.

Jane spent  7 years as the Practice Manager of North Terrace Optometrists and will be the smiling face welcoming you in to our practice most days. 

Where you might not expect to find Jane is on a red hot Honda motorcycle! Ask her about how she broke her foot...
