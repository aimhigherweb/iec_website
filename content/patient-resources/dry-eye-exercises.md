##### Lid hygiene



##### Warm compress

The glands need to be heated to only 40-50 degrees which amounts to about 20-25 seconds in the microwave. The compress then needs to be kept over your eyes for a full 10 minutes, followed by 1 minute of blink training (see below). Performed regularly, this process helps to maintain regular function of the glands for an adequate protective lipid layer.

##### Blink training

Think blink! Consider doing blink exercises whenever you are in a drying environment and any other times when your eyes are uncomfortable. Pay attention to your blinking whenever you are concentrating: working on a computer or smartphone and take a moment to do your blink exercises if you start to experience discomfort.
