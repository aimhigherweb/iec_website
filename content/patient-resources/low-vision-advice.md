  <tr>
    <td>Illumination</td>
    <td><p>* Proper illumination is needed when doing tasks up close</p><p>* Brighter than normal lights can help with reading and other close activities including sewing and cooking</p><p>* Hang clothes in a very well-lit closet</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Contrast</td>
    <td><p>* Place brightly coloured accessories around the home to help
locate objects</p><p>* Use contrasting colours to clearly define doorknobs, plates, switches, outlets, stairways, etc.</p><p>* Use markers, soft tip pens and lined paper when writing. A yellow background can maintain a good contrast and reduces glare</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Magnification</td>
    <td><p>* Large print is typically easier to read</p><p>* When possible, use devices that have larger print such as watches with a large face, stopwatches, tape measures and cell phones</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Meals</td>
    <td><p>* Use two sets of dishes, one dark and one white, that are good
to contrast with the food. For example, mashed potatoes or white rice will be easier to see on a dark blue plate</p><p>* Use different coloured glasses for different drinks - for example, white cups of various sizes for dark drinks like coffee or tea</p><p>* To avoid overdoing the salt or spices, put a little in your hand and then sprinkle on the food the amount desired</p><p>* If eating out avoid the most complicated dishes- it's better to order pasta or fish filet, such as salmon</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Other</td>
    <td><p>* Well organise drawers / shelves / first aid kits to avoid frustrating searches</p><p>* Sunglasses allow greater comfort in the presence of light and glare</p><p>* Avoid upholstery and carpets with patterns, because these can create visual confusion - instead, choose textured furniture, offering tactile cues for identification</p><p>* Affix the rugs on the floor with tape and remove electrical cords to reduce the risk of falls and injuries</p></td>
