<p>If your optometrist finds a <a href="/what-we-do/childrens-vision">binocular vision problem</a> during your <a href="/what-we-do/eye-exam">examination</a>, it could be improved with the use of visual training.  Problems with binocular vision that can be corrected include accommodative dysfunction, convergence insufficiency or phoria decompensation. Our Adelaide and Woodville branches offer treatment options for a variety of children's vision issues.</p>

For all of us, good vision is dependent on a range of different aspects. Vision is more than just being able to see; it involves both eyes working together, the brain correctly processing information, focusing on the task at hand, and integrating this with the rest of the body to effectively make use of visual input.

Firstly, a patient’s vision has to be appropriately corrected for them to achieve clear vision in the distance. Refractive errors including [myopia](/what-we-do/myopia) (short-sightedness), [hyperopia](/what-we-do/hyperopia) (long-sightedness) and [astigmatism](/what-we-do/astigmatism) can cause blur if left uncorrected. [Spectacles](/what-we-do/glasses) or [contact lenses](/what-we-do/contact-lenses) are used in these situations.

However, there are other necessary visual skills for a person to see clearly and comfortably across a range of distances and visual tasks. These include a patient’s near focusing ability (accommodation), the accuracy of their focusing, their ability to keep their two eyes well aligned, and their ability to maintain this focus and alignment when the eyes are moving or when stressed or tired.

A deficit in one of these binocular vision skills may lead to blurring, double vision, eye-strain and headache, fatigue, poor balance, loss of concentration and difficulty reading for periods of time. Most of these visual conditions will improve by using vision training exercises. This process is similar to using physiotherapy exercises to rehabilitate a damaged joint back to normal function.

Typically, your optometrist will prescribe a range of exercises depending on the problem. They will review your progress and modify your exercises over time to improve the results. Even after full recovery, exercises may be needed on occasion in the future to keep your eyes well trained and working effectively.

Instructions for these visual training exercises can be found here:

If your child needs visual training, they will need your support with the program because the exercises can be challenging at times and encouragement may be needed to stay motivated. Sometimes it's helpful to have a reward system in place. We also recommend your child uses the <i>**[diary provided](https://d1hd12f7n4y2a6.cloudfront.net/innovative-eye-care%2Fedf9851d-0310-406f-976a-92f88dfa0a0c_innovativeeyecarevisualtrainingdiary.pdf)**</i> to mark off that they have completed their exercises for the day. This also helps your optometrist to monitor how often the exercises have been done and track progress. To maximise the effectiveness of the program we recommend doing the exercises for a short time and more often rather than in one longer session.

Don't forget that the symptoms we are trying to treat may get worse before they get better. It is much like someone training to run a marathon – the first training run is often the hardest, but this same run is easier after more training. Because we are working a system that has been under-performing for a long period of time, it will take some time and effort to improve. One thing is generally a rule; if you do not do the exercises then the symptoms are unlikely to improve!

## New Information

The human visual system is complex. Some visual conditions such as short-sightedness (myopia), long-sightedness (hyperopia) and astigmatism can be corrected via the use of spectacles or contact lenses. Other problems with a patient's vision can arise from poor binocular vision skills. These skills relate to how well a patient's two eyes are working together.

At Innovative Eye Care, both our Adelaide and Woodville practice are equipped to prescribe vision training for a variety of children’s vision issues

Vision training involves a series of activities which are individually prescribed in order to develop or improve a patient's visual skills.

Symptoms commonly described by patients relating to dysfunction of these skills include:

* Blurred vision (particularly after prolonged near work)
* Difficulty reading
* Poor concentration
* Headaches or eye strain
* Double vision
* Words moving a page
* Sensitivity to light

The visual skills important include accommodation (eye focusing), vergence (eye alignment) and eye movement

### Accommodation (Eye Focusing)

Accommodation refers to the eyes ability to focus clearly on objects when looking at distance objects to near objects. It is controlled by the ciliary muscle inside of the eye which changes the shape of the lenses, changing where it focuses.

Vision training specifically targeted for improving eye focusing aims to improve and develop good control of the ciliary muscle.

### Vergence (Eye Alignment)

Vergence refers to the ability of the eyes to turn in and out in order to avoid seeing double vision. If the object moves closer to us, the eyes need to rotate in (towards the nose) which is known as convergence. If the object moves further away from us, the eyes need to rotate out (away from the nose) which is known as divergence

Vision training specifically targeted for improving eye alignment aims to improve and develop the brain's control of the eye muscles so they are able to move accurately and stay aligned.

### Eye Movements

Eye movements refer to the ability for the eyes to move effectively from one point to another. These skills are especially important for reading which involves reading words across the page and then finding the next line to read. Poor control of eye movements can lead to symptoms such as words moving on a page causing reading difficulties.

Vision training specifically targeted for improving eye movement aims to improve and develop the control and accuracy of these movements.

### Evidence

Vision training has been highly researched. Strong evidence exists regarding its effectiveness at treating binocular vision problems. Specific treatment of eye focusing and eye teaming problems result in reduced symptoms and improvement in visual function (1-4). [](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?6X0I1Q)Other studies have shown that vision training can result in improvements in school performance such as reading comprehension, reading speed and fluency as well as attention (5-7).[](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?HBch0K)

The success of vision training has been shown to be affected by participant effort. Improvements in a patient's binocular system are seen in patients who demonstrate commitment to their exercises (8).[](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?OLhmTe)

Importantly, vision training exercises also have cross-over benefits whereby exercising your eye focusing can have beneficial effects on your eye turning skills (8).[](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?SX4ojM)

### Who Can Benefit from Vision Therapy?

Binocular vision problems are quite common in the general population. Studies have shown that poor eye alignment is found in around 13% of patients and poor eye focusing is found in around 21% of patients (9,10). [](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?bauyZl)One study screened over 1,500 kids and revealed that around 53% of children had some degree of binocular vision problem (11). [](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?sDWQZ2)These rates increase even further in children who have reading difficulties where higher proportions of binocular vision problems are seen (12).[](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?YzwIEy)

Adults can also benefit from vision training, not just children. Due to the increased usage of computer screens in an occupational setting, people working in front of computer screens can experience ocular discomfort or blurred vision. These symptoms can be linked to problems with a patient's binocular vision which can be trained and improved through vision therapy (13).[](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?idPos2)

### Length and Equipment

The length and course of vision training can vary and is dependent on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the severity of the condition and the rate of improvement. Training usually ranges from several months to more extended periods of training. After the initial period of therapy, the optometry will re-evaluate the patients binocular vision system and assess for signs of improvement. Even after full recovery, exercises may still be needed occasionally to keep your eyes well trained and working effectively.

Forms of vision therapy require specialised equipment in order to train and develop a patient's eye focusing or eye alignment. Theses are available at both our Adelaide and Woodville practices
