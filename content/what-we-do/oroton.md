One of Australia's best-known designer fashion houses, Oroton is synonymous with craftsmanship, accessible luxury and a unique Australian sense of beauty. Born from textile production in 1938, it grew to incorporate sunglasses in its collection in 2000, 62 years later. Re-imagining utility into an object of beauty is an intrinsic part of Oroton’s identity, where flair for glamourous mixes perfectly with an aptitude for the practical. Importantly, they never compromise on sustainability – they have a strong commitment to ethical sourcing for all their products.
