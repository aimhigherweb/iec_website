#### What are soft contact lenses?

Soft contact lenses provide clear vision and lens wetability, and they are generally comfortable enough to wear all day. They are made from a polymer-plastic material combined with water. The water content varies with different lenses. Newer generation soft lenses are made out variants of a material called silicone hydrogel, which allows more oxygen to reach the eye and prevents some of the ocular health issues that older lens materials would cause.<sup>1,2</sup> Soft contact lenses can correct a range of prescriptions including [myopia](/what-we-do/myopia), [hyperopia](/what-we-do/hyperopia), [astigmatism](/what-we-do/astigmatism) and [presbyopia](/what-we-do/presbyopia).

#### What types of soft contact lenses are there?

* **Daily lenses:** Daily lenses are discarded after each use. These soft lenses are perfect for users who don’t wear contact lenses every day – they are more cost-effective to replace and don’t require cleaning or storage solutions. There’s also a reduced risk of infection and inflammation in daily lenses because there’s no opportunity for proteins or pathogens to build up on the lens with such frequent replacement, and the silicone hydrogel material allows the eye to remain healthy.<sup>1,2</sup> Check with your optometrist whether daily soft contact lenses are right for you, as they come in a limited range of prescriptions.
* **Monthly lenses:** Monthly or fortnightly lenses are replaced monthly or fortnightly, as the name suggests. That means they require [disinfection and storage with solutions](https://eyesolutions.com.au/) after each wear. For this same reason there is a slightly higher risk of infection or inflammatory events due to debris build-up.<sup>1,2</sup> However, these soft contact lenses are available in a wider array of prescriptions and they can often be just as cost-effective as daily lenses for full-time wearers, even when factoring in the price of solutions. The oxygen supply is also similar to daily lenses with silicone hydrogel materials.

#### How do I know if soft contact lenses are right for me?

An <a href="/what-we-do/eye-exam">appointment</a> with your optometrist is required to discern if soft contact lenses are a good choice for you. This is for a multitude of reasons; your script might not be available, your ocular health might not allow it, your lifestyle might not be suited, and the like. If we do discover that soft lenses aren't appropriate, there are still other options.

#### What are the alternatives to soft lenses?

At Innovative Eye Care, we offer alternatives to soft lenses. Each individual person has a unique set of requirements for clear vision and comfort, and soft lenses may not always be suitable. Other possibilities include [rigid lenses](/what-we-do/rigid-gas-permeable-contact-lenses), [scleral lenses](/what-we-do/scleral-contact-lenses) and [orthokeratology](/what-we-do/orthokeratology-corneal-reshaping). There are also a range of treatments for specific conditions such as [myopia control](/what-we-do/myopia-control).
