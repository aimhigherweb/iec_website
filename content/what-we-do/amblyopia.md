<p>Amblyopia (sometimes called a 'lazy' eye) is a developmental reduction of vision in one or both eyes. Amblyopia occurs as a child and is most commonly caused when one eye points in the wrong direction or is badly defocused compared to the fellow eye. As only a sub-standard image is capable of being detected by the brain from that eye, the visual processing pathways cannot fully form.</p>
<p> Our practices in Adelaide and Woodville are equipped with new technology and determined optometrists who are able to improve vision for younger patients with amblyopia. Without treatment the eye will continue to see poorly for the remainder of the patient's life, even when accurately corrected with glasses or contact lenses.</p>

Amblyopia can arise due to several different reasons, the common factor being that one eye does not receive the same clear image focused at the correct part of the retina as the other eye. As a result, during visual development the connections made from the eye to the visual cortex in the brain are unable to form fully. If untreated this developmental barrier becomes permanent and will affect vision permanently despite optical correction. There are three main types of amblyopia.

##### Refractive amblyopia
This is where a high presciption in the eye such as astigmatism or hyperopia results in a blurry image being formed on the retina of the worse eye.

##### Form-deprivation amblyopia 
This is apparent in much younger patients who are born with a congenital cataract or a droopy lid (ptosis) that stops the eye from seeing clearly through the obstruction.

##### Strabismic amblyopia
This is where one eye is misaligned compared to the normal eye (called a strabismus, or commonly a 'squint', or 'turned' eye) and as a result the clear image is focused on the wrong part of the retina.

#### Treating ambylopia
There is a 'critical period' that occurs before the age of 8-9 years where the visual cortex is still 'plastic' and can be modified. During this time treatment can be initiated to try and improve the vision. The earlier this treatment starts the better the chance of improvement. Treatment for amblyopia initially consists of removing the causative factor, for example prescribing glasses or contact lenses or surgically straightening the eye. If amblyopia persists with these modifications then amblyopia therapy can be instigated, and can involve the following:

##### Atropine therapy
1% Atropine eyedrops cause blurry vision and pupil dilation. These are instilled in the good eye to make the bad eye do most of the visual work. These drops are only using in low-moderate levels of amblyopia.

##### Occlusion therapy
This involves the child using an occlusive patch over the <i>good</i> eye to force the bad eye to carry out visual tasks and make the correct connections with the brain. Typically patching is only required for a few hours a day and is best combined with visually stimulating tasks such as video games, reading or television programmes. **Visit our [patching](/patient-resources/patching-therapy-for-amblyopia) page for more information about this therapy.**

CAPTION: Patches worn for amblyopia therapy are often fun and brightly coloured to encourage wear. 

In some eyes even with treatment the amblyopic eye may not recover the same vision as the good eye. Enabling the amblyopic eye to see at a level that can meet a driving standard is often deemed a success. This is so that the patient can still function in society should something happen to affect the good eye. In these instances care should be taken to protect the good eye with safety glasses in the future during physical activities like sport. 

Exciting new research is showing that older children and adults may be able to improve their amblyopia to some extent with the use of computer assisted therapy.
