Anne & Valentin are a French brand that loves graphic and original frames. They decided to create what they couldnâ€™t find across other framewear brands today. In the Anne & Valentin creation studio, they're constantly redesigning and rethinking the relationship between reliefs and face. The frames are the concrete manifestations of these ideas.

With their flagship store in Toulose, France, they have expanded over the years and opened stores in Paris, New York and Seattle. These frames are perfect for those whose personal style includes a little bit of European flare.
