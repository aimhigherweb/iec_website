<p><p>The Eaglet Eye - ESP is a corneo-scleral topographer, meaning it maps out the shape of the front of the eye. The term topography refers to the study of the shape and features of land surfaces, and just like mountains, the front surface of our eyes has unique shapes and features. Not only is it important to assess the shape of the cornea, but it is just as important to accurately assess the shape of the surrounding sclera (the white part of the eye). </p> 

<p>At Innovative Eye Care, our optometrists are equipped with the latest technology which allows us to map out and produce a three dimensional image of the front surface of your eye. The Eaglet-Eye ESP is particularly special, as it is the first topographer with the ability to map out the sclera as well as the cornea, with incredible accuracy.<sup>1, 2</sup> 

<p>Many conditions and procedures can alter the shape of the sclera, including keratoconus and corneal cross linking. <sup>3, 4, 5</sup> The three dimensional maps attained by the Eaglet Eye - ESP allows our optometrists to monitor keratoconus and gain a better understanding of how it is affecting our patient's eyes. <sup>4</sup> 

<p> The Eaglet-Eye ESP is also very useful for when designing custom made scleral contact lenses. <sup>6</sup> These lenses are large diameter lenses that are typically 16-18mm in diameter. Where conventional corneal topographers can only achieve a 14mm diameter scan, the Eaglet-Eye ESP gives us a much bigger picture, achieving a whopping 20mm diameter scan! <sup>2, 6</sup>
