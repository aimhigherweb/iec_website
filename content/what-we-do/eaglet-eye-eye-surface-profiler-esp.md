<p>The Pentacam AXL Wave is the latest addition to Innovative Eye Care’s arsenal of advanced imaging technology at the Hutt Street branch. It's main functionality is as a tomographer, a machine that scans the tissues at the front of the eye. It also serves as a topographer (maps the eye’s front surface), an imager (captures the anterior eye’s structure), autorefractor (approximates refractive error extremely accurately), wavefront aberrometer (quantifies the eye’s lower-order and higher-order aberrations affecting vision) and ocular biometer (measures the physical parameters of the eye).</p>

Due to its extensive abilities, the Pentacam AXL Wave has applications for all patients, but especially in the management of corneal thinning disease (ectasia) like keratoconus and PMD, in bespoke contact lens design, and for the management of myopia, or short-sightedness. The Pentacam AXL Wave is on the cutting edge of tomography, advancing beyond reflection-based systems, and is able to directly measure the elevation of both the cornea – the clear structure at the front of the eye that bends light, and the sclera – the white part of the eye important in designing scleral lenses. It also has many other functions relating to pinpoint accuracy of glasses and CL prescription, myopia control and cataract.

The Pentacam AXL Wave tomographer uses Scheimpflug imaging to map the front and back surfaces of the cornea as well as its thickness and volume, the anterior chamber conformation and volume, and the anterior lens topography and density. This is a step beyond what most topographers use (Placido disc imaging) which maps only the front corneal surface. Its accuracy as a non-contact alternative independent of tear film quality has been proven in countless clinical trials. For this reason, it’s much better for mapping eyes with dry eye disease, and in the design of various custom-made contact lenses including orthokeratology, bespoke RGP and scleral lenses.
