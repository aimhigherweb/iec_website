<p>Myopia, commonly called shortsightedness, is a condition in which light is focused in front of the retina, resulting in blurred vision. This is normally due to the eye being too long for the focusing power of the eye. Shortsighted people can often see reasonably clearly at short distances, but will not be able to see distant objects clearly.</p>
<p>At our Adelaide and Woodville practices, our optometrists offer <a href="/what-we-do/myopia-control">myopia control</a> treatments to prevent the progression of myopia. If you are interested in knowing more, please contact our staff or <a href="/what-we-do/eye-exam">book an appointment</a>.</p>

There is currently no cure for myopia, but [spectacles](/what-we-do/glasses), [contact lenses](/what-we-do/contact-lenses), [orthokeratology](/what-we-do/orthokeratology-corneal-reshaping) and refractive surgery can all provide good distance vision for people with this condition. Due to the structural change to the eye, myopia increases the risk of ocular disease such as [retinal detachment](/what-we-do//what-we-do/flashes-floaters-retinal-tear-detachment), [cataract](/what-we-do/cataract) and [glaucoma](/what-we-do/glaucoma) later in life.<sup>1,2</sup>

#### How can I tell if I am shortsighted?

Shortsighted people have difficulty seeing distant objects clearly. They find it hard to read road signs and scoreboards and to play ball games, and recognising people in the distance may also be a problem. Often a person will not realise that they cannot see clearly until they have an eye examination.

#### How can I tell if my child is shortsighted?

A complete eye test is the only sure way of determining whether your child's vision is normal. Some clues to myopia in a child include:

* Screwing up eyes to see distant objects
* Difficulty reading the whiteboard at school
* Sitting close to the screen when watching television
* Holding iPads and books close to the face
* Lack of interest in playing outdoor games

#### What causes myopia?

The exact causes of myopia are not known. At various times people have blamed excessive amounts of reading, poor metabolism, poor diet, poor light, poor posture and genetic factors. Recent research has shown that the development of myopia is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.<sup>2</sup>

#### Can myopia be cured?

Despite ongoing research, a cure for myopia has not yet been found. Properly prescribed spectacles or contact lenses, including [orthokeratology](/what-we-do/orthokeratology-corneal-reshaping) lenses, will enable a person with myopia to see clearly. [Soft contact lenses](/what-we-do/soft-contact-lenses) can also be useful, particularly VTI brand NaturalVue and Coopervision MiSight lenses. Laser surgery to permanently reshape the front surface of the eye can also help some people with myopia. Your optometrist can advise you about the latest developments and whether they would be suitable for you.

#### Can myopia be prevented?

The progression of myopia can be slowed and in some cases halted completely with precision-fitted contact lenses or therapeutic eye drops. See our [Myopia Control page](/what-we-do/myopia-control) for more information.

#### How common is myopia?

It is a very common condition. About 30% of the population is shortsighted and by 2050, it is predicted that 50% of the population will be myopic.<sup>3</sup> Usually myopia begins to develop in early teenage years and it commonly gets worse over the following few years.
