A variety of situations call for safety eyewear to protect your eyes - after all you only get one pair! A number of blinding eye injuries that occur each year in Australia could have been avoided with the use of safety glasses. These can be made with your prescription included to give clear vision when you need to protect your eyes.

All Innovative Eye Care's safety eyewear products are independently tested to AS/NZS 1337.6.2012 and subsequently all products are endorsed and certified by SAI Global. This ensures all Innovative Eye Care's safety eyewear products meet the highest available quality and assurance available.

Innovative Eye Care has access to one of the largest frame and lens ranges available in the market, including leading brands such as Boll√©, Ugly Fish and Matador Equipment. Our range includes a broad range of styles, including plastic and metal frames, and a variety of positive seal products as well.

Innovative Eye Care uses Phoenix lens material for all Medium Impact safety eyewear. Phoenix is a unique proprietary lens material and is completely resistant to common chemicals, making it the perfect material for safety in the workplace when compared to other lens materials. Phoenix is also extremely light-weight, making it more comfortable to wear than other Medium Impact lens materials. Phoenix is also clearer to look through than other lens materials, such as the conventional polycarbonate available, meaning you get crisper, clearer vision in all light conditions without compromising quality of vision.
