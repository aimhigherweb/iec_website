Innovative Eye Care is the first practice in South Australia to exclusively offer the Vivid Vision virtual reality vision training program. Vivid Vision uses cutting edge technology to help your eyes work together and improve your 3D vision. At our Adelaide practice, our optometrists can help you see more clearly and comfortably, with an individually tailored program, that is also a bit of fun!

This treatment is revolutionary for patients with: 

* Amblyopia ("lazy eye")
* Strabismus 
* Convergence insufficiency 
* Binocular vision disorders 

Previously, these conditions were only able to be treated with patching or vision training, however, advances in technology now allow us to accurately assess and treat your eyes with interactive and exciting virtual reality exercises! 

Muscles in the eye are just like any other muscle in the body. Sometimes they just need a little work to make them stronger. Just like exercise for the rest of the body, we need to build the strength of these muscles up slowly over time. With Vivid Vision, our optometrists can develop a personally tailored program for your eyes.
