Innovative Eye Care is the first practice in South Australia to exclusively offer the Vivid Vision virtual reality vision training program. Vivid Vision uses cutting-edge technology to help your eyes work together and improve your 3D vision. At our Adelaide practice, our optometrists can help you see more clearly and comfortably, with an individually tailored program, that is also a bit of fun!</p></div>

Muscles in the eye are just like any other muscle in the body. For many reasons, they can be weaker and fatigue more easily than the general population. This can cause problems like blurry vision, double vision and eye turns. The good news is that like other muscles, the muscles of the eye can also be trained over time and become increasingly resistant to fatigue so that these symptoms become less frequent even with intense amounts of near work involving reading, writing or screens. With Vivid Vision, our optometrists can develop a personally tailored program for your eyes, like a personal trainer. This treatment is revolutionary for patients with:<sup>1, 2</sup> 

* [Amblyopia](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/amblyopia/) ("lazy eye")
* Strabismus 
* Binocular vision disorders including [convergence insufficiency](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/convergence-insufficiency/)

Previously, these conditions were only able to be treated with patching or vision training. These therapies can often be uninteresting, especially for young children. This poses a problem because conditions like strabismus and BV disorders are exacerbated with fatigue. With Vivid Vision, the interactivity of the virtual reality (VR) exercises helps keeps kids engaged and allows them to train their eyes for longer. Because of the digital nature of VR, we are now also able to better assess and track improvement with this program.
