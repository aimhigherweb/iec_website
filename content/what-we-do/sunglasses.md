Maui Jim sunglasses are designed with brilliant vision in mind. Their philosophy is centred around finding new ways to reveal more of the vibrant colours of the world while protecting your eyes from the effects of harsh glare and harmful rays. Every pair of Mauiâ€™s are fitted with their industry leading proprietary polarised lenses. Your personal prescription can be made into a pair of Maui Jim lenses and frame to ensure that you enjoy clear, comfortable vision that suits your individual personality and lifestyle.

For those who wish to enjoy the convenience of wearing the same pair of glasses for both indoor and outdoor activities, Innovative Eye Care offers photochromic and [tinted lenses](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/glasses). These stay clear indoors but darken to aid in glare reduction when you walk outside.
