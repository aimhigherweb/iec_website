<p>Anterior imaging (imaging of the front of the eye) is vital for detecting and recording important information about your eye health, as well as for providing information about the shape of your eye in <a href="/what-we-do/contact-lenses">contact lens</a> fittings. At Innovative Eye Care, we use the highest quality equipment using a variety of imaging methods across our Adelaide and Woodville practices, including the <i>Pentacam AXL Wave</i>, the <i>Heidelberg Spectralis</i> and standard <i>slit lamp biomicroscopes with HD Canon photography</i>.</p>

As well as being useful in anterior imaging is very useful in order to photodocument any unusual aspects of your eyes that might indicate disease or other abnormalities, such as [pterygium](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/pterygium-pinguecula), [cataracts](/what-we-do/cataract) and [keratoconus](/what-we-do/keratoconus). Photos are also vital for tracking the healing of your eyes â€“ for example, following a [corneal infection](/what-we-do/keratitis). Your optometrist will show you the different photos in the exam room to explain more about your eyes and any ocular conditions you might have. As they say, a picture tells a thousand words!

#### Pentacam AXL Wave

The Pentacam AXL Wave uses Scheimpflug imaging to scan the tissues at the front of the eye. It maps the front and back corneal surfaces, as well as its thickness and volume. It also captures information about the anterior chamber (in particular its conformation and volume), and the anterior lens topography and density. Its ability to scan the anterior eye in extreme detail makes it ideal for use in managing complex disease and to design various custom-made contact lenses including [orthokeratology](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/orthokeratology-corneal-reshaping), [bespoke RGP](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/gas-permeable-contact-lenses) and [scleral lenses](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/scleral-contact-lenses).

#### Heidelberg Spectralis

The Heidelberg Spectralis is a state-of-the-art [OCT machine](https://innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/oct) that takes highly detailed cross-sectional scans of your eye. Typically used for imaging the optic nerve and retina at the [back of the eye](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/retinal-photography), the same principles can be applied to the cornea, sclera, iris and lens at the front of the eye. Its especially useful when assessing the fit of rigid contact lenses (namely [scleral lenses](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/scleral-contact-lenses)) where the 'landing zones', or areas where the lens makes contact with the eye, can be manipulated for better comfort.

#### Slit lamp biomicroscopy

All of our consulting rooms at both practices are equipped with Medmont E300 [corneal topographers](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/corneal-topography), which give accurate mathematical information about the shape of the front of your eye, a feature that's especially important for [ortho-K](https://innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/orthokeratology-corneal-reshaping) and [rigid lens](https://innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/gas-permeable-contact-lenses) wearers and in diagnosing refractive conditions like [astigmatism](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/hyperopia), [myopia](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/myopia) and [hyperopia](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/hyperopia).
