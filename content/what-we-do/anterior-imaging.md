<p>The 'anterior' of digital anterior imaging refers to the front of the eye. Anterior photography is vital for detecting and recording important information about your eye health. At Innovative Eye Care we use the highest quality equipment to ensure the best monitoring of our patients' eyes. </p>

Both our Adelaide and Woodville practices are equipped with slit-lamp bio-microscopes that have a high quality Canon digital camera incorporated to take high resolution images. Your optometrist will use these for a magnified and detailed view of your eyes during your eye examination.

Anterior photography is very useful in order to photo-document any unusual aspects of your eyes such as pigmented lesions, anatomical abnormalities and the presence of eye diseases such as [cataracts](/what-we-do/cataract) and [keratoconus](/what-we-do/keratoconus). Photos are also vital for tracking the healing of your eyes â€“ for example, following a [corneal infection](/what-we-do/keratitis). When fitting contact lenses such as [orthokeratology](/what-we-do/orthokeratology), it is useful to have photos of the fit for valuable information about how your lenses will perform and feel. 

Your optometrist will show you the different photos in the exam room to explain more about your eyes and any ocular conditions you might have. As they say, a picture tells a thousand words!
