<p>Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses are made with stiff silicone polymers that allow oxygen to pass through to the cornea, giving them their name. If you would like to know if you are a candidate for rigid lenses, make an <a href="/what-we-do/eye-exam">appointment</a> with one of our practitioners.</p>

Conditions such as [myopia](/what-we-do/myopia), [astigmatism](/what-we-do/astigmatism), aphakia, [keratoconus](/what-we-do/keratoconus), and irregular corneas benefit from RGP lenses.<sup>1,2</sup> This is because they hold their shape and provide an even front optical surface for the eye, unlike soft contact lenses. RGP lens wearers experience clear, high-quality vision with a higher safety profile than any other contact lens.<sup>3</sup> RGPs are more durable and last longer than soft contact lenses, often being worn for over a year before they require replacement.

At Innovative Eye Care we use a customised lens design program called EyeSpace to accurately design the fit and power of your lens unique to your eye. Our Adelaide and Woodville practices are equipped with a multitude of state-of-the-art equipment including [corneal topography](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/corneal-topography), [corneal tomography](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/corneal-tomography) and [wavefront aberrometry](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/wavefront-aberrometry). This allows our optometrists to custom design RGP lenses for our patients that can improve vision for wearers with a range of eye conditions.

Rigid lenses may take a little longer to adapt to before they are as comfortable as soft contact lenses. For advice on rigid contact lenses and solutions, please consult our <a href="/what-we-do/eye-exam">team</a>. For insertion, removal, cleaning and maintenance regimes, see our page on [care of gas permeable contact lenses](/patient-resources/U3l2xwEAADQADBFJ/care-of-gas-permeable-lenses).

Certain types of rigid lenses can be worn overnight, changing the shape of the cornea while you sleep and eliminating the need to wear spectacles or contact lenses during the day (see our [orthokeratology](/what-we-do/orthokeratology-corneal-reshaping) page).
