Prodesign brings the essential spirit of Danish design and lifestyle values to the global eyewear market. After 30 years of solid experience with a customer base now measured in the thousands, Prodesign is both an experienced, well-established eyewear manufacturer and a modern, forward thinking company. Innovative Eye Care stocks select models from its [Danish Heritage collection](http://prodesigndenmark.com/product-category/optical/danish-heritage/), including frames with clip-ons.

##### Why we love Prodesign

The designs are thoughtful, clean and creative. Each frame is painstakingly crafted to suit different facial shapes. They are tumbled with wood or stone and polished for a beautiful tactile finish.

  * Danish design
  * Perfectly balances artistry and functionality
  * Bold colours in classic shapes
