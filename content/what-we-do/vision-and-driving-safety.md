Driving is a task that most people perform everyday. This involves judging distances, reading street signs, using our visual field and processing dynamic information. There are many visual factors which affect an individual's driving performance.

### The Facts

- Around **90%** of the decisions we make while driving are based on **visual information.**<sup>1</sup>
- **Poor eyesight** is the **main risk factor** for road crashes.<sup>1</sup>
- 20% of drivers can't see the road clearly due to uncorrected poor vision and have a 30% higher crash involvement rate.<sup>2</sup>
- Importantly, **80%** of all vision impairments can be **prevented or cured.**<sup>3</sup>
- By age 50, risk of road accidents increase due to:

  - **Increased light sensitivity** to glare created by headlights.
  - **Impaired depth perception** and judgement of distances.
  - **Difficulty seeing clearly** due to uncorrected eye prescription.

### Night Time Driving

- At night, drivers notice the following:

  - Driving is riskier and more challenging
  - **Visibility** is limited
  - The **ability to detect and response** to dangers is reduced

### Glare

- Glare is the **most complained about visual discomfort** by drivers.
- It can occur during daytime and nighttime and is caused by excessive or uncontrolled brightness.
- It is **caused by various different ocular diseases** including but not limited to cataracts, uncorrected refractive error (short-sightedness, long-sightedness or astigmatism)
- When driving, glare **slows detection and reaction time.**<sup>4</sup>

### Visual Field

- Around 50% of people with some form of visual field loss are unaware of the problem.<sup>5</sup>
- Studies have shown that people with visual field defects have **double the risk** of road crashes and traffic violations.<sup>5</sup>

### Colour Vision Deficiencies

- **Colour vision deficiencies (CVD)** affect approximately **1 in 12 men** and **1 in 200 women** in the world.
- CVD can be due to genetics or can develop over time due to ocular distance.
- The visibility of road signs for people with colour vision deficiencies is often reduced.<sup>6</sup>

### Recommendations

In order to stay safe on the road and maintain good vision, we recommend the following:

- Get your vision and ocular health routinely checked by your optometrist.
- Wear any recommended spectacles, contact lenses or vision aids when driving.
- Protect your eyes from glare on sunny days with sunglasses (preferably polarised sunglasses).

  - ​Polarised lenses have been shown to improve driver reaction times during the day by eliminating reflected glare.<sup>4</sup>
