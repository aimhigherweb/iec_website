<p><p>All of our spectacle lenses are Australia-made by <a href="http://www.crsurfacing.com.au/">CR Surfacing Laboratories</a>, Australia's premium lens laboratory. Their most recent lens series, <i>Perfection</i>, was released in late 2017 and combines the latest advanced manufacturing technologies with our complex lens design software to produce world-class quality lenses. There are many different types of spectacle lenses, each designed to suit a particular vision problem. Features such as anti-reflective coatings and lens tinting can add extra functionality to your lenses to suit your lifestyle.</p>

#### Lens Types

##### Single vision lenses

[Single vision lenses](https://www.perfectionlens.com/portfolio-items/single-vision/) are the most commonly prescribed type of vision correction in spectacles. These have the same focal power over the whole lens and can be used to correct a variety of vision problems, including myopia and hyperopia. Some of the more sophisticated Perfection single vision lenses are particularly accurate, with 10,000 control points on the lens during manufacturing.

##### Progressive lenses

[Progressive lenses](https://www.perfectionlens.com/portfolio-items/everyday/) allow you to see near, intermediate and long distances without needing to change spectacle. The top area of the lens is used for distance vision and the bottom area is used for close vision, while the middle area is used for intermediate viewing. As there is no visible line separating the different areas, these lenses are the most cosmetically appealing. The field of view in a progressive lens is narrower than in a single vision lens or bifocal, and there is some blur outside of the central corridor of the lens. Most patients adapt to this very well after a few weeks by learning to move their eyes and head together to keep their gaze through the 'sweet spot' of the lens.

##### Occupational lenses

[Occupationals](https://www.perfectionlens.com/portfolio-items/device/), or IT lenses, solve the problem of a pair of reading glasses not providing clear vision on computers and intermediate objects. Because of this, some optometrists refer to them as the modern-day reading glasses. Occuptionals are a variety of progressive lens designed to give a wider field of view for intermediate and near focuses. These lenses do not provide clear vision for distance but are great for anyone in an office environment, as the top of the lens gives a customised focus for distances further away than your habitual reading point.

#### Lens coatings

Your glasses are constantly exposed to conditions causing wear and tear. A scratch resistant coating helps to improve the durability of the lens, helping your lenses to last longer. [CR Surfacing](http://www.crsurfacing.com.au/coatings/) offers many Satin coatings for this purpose.

##### Satin UV coating

The Satin UV coating from CR Surfacing provides superior UV protection, glare reduction, durability, anti-scratch, anti-fog and water-repellent properties.

##### Satin Blue

Blue-light emanates from LED screens in technology that we use every day - phones, tablets, computers and televisions. Satin Blue protects your eyes by selectively filtering blue light, to comfort your eyes whilst looking at a screen and still providing excellent clarity. Satin Blue lenses are scratch resistant, smudge and water resistant and dust repellant, ideal for every day use, no matter what environment you are in.

##### Satin anti-reflective coating

Anti-reflective coatings help to prevent glare and reflections. These can be particularly important for higher prescriptions, computer use and night driving. They are cosmetically appealing, allowing people to see your eyes rather than reflections from the lenses.

#### Tinted lenses

All types of lens, including multifocals, can be permanently tinted to provide glare protection when in the sun.  Driving and watersports especially can be improved with the use of polarised sunglass lenses. These eliminate unwanted reflections from road surfaces and water.  To give more functionality to your normal spectacles you can choose to have them made with a photochromatic lens. These are activated by UV light, darkening when outside and lightening to a completely clear lens inside. This process often takes less than a minute, making them suitable for full-time wear without having to worry about carrying an extra pair of sunglasses.

#### Refractive index

The refractive index helps to reduce the volume of the lens material, resulting in a thinner lens. The higher the refractive index, the more dense the plastic. Depending on your spectacle script and frame selection, you may want to consider a higher index in order to make your lenses feel more comfortable, more durable and thinner. Ask our friendly staff about the refractive index.

If you wear a minus lens (for [nearsightedness](/what-we-do/myopia)), your lens will be concave in shape – thinner at the middle and thicker at the edges. The edge thickness can be reduced with a higher refractive index. With a plus lens (for [farsightedness](/what-we-do/hyperopia)) the lens shape is convex – thinner at the edges and thicker at the centre. The central thickness will be reduced as the refractive index increases.
