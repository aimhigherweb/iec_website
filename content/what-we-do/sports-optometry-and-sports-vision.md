<p>In sports, the following phrases are often stated for good reason: “your eyes lead the body”, “keep your eye on the ball” and “you can’t hit what you can’t see”. Your vision makes up 80% of your total perceptual input and is the sense which has the most impact on sports performance.<sup>1</sup> Studies have shown that professional athletes in various sports have greater visual-perceptual and visual-cognitive skills. <sup>2</sup> 

The following are aspects of vision which can impact an athlete’s visual potential: 

* **Visual accuracy (acuity).** This can be measured both statically (black letters on white background) or dynamically (introducing motion). 
* **Ocular dominance.** Also known as eye preference, this relates to the eye that preferentially fixates on an object (like being left or right handed!). 
* **Eye tracking.** There are many different types of eye movements which follow an athlete to track a ball, make quick decisions and maintain balance.<sup>3</sup> Saccadic eye movements are involved in rapid scanning. vestibulo-ocular movements assist with balance and coordinate the eyes relative to the head movement. Vergence eye movements allow the eyes to track and object as it comes closer or further away (convergence and divergence). Slow pursuits relate to slow and controlled eye movements which track slow moving objects. 
* **Visual memory.** The ability to remember details (both short-term and long-term). 
* **Peripheral vision.** Used to detect the motion and movement of objects around you. Good peripheral vision can improve anticipation skills and reaction time.
* **Depth perception.** Important for catching, fine motor skills and dynamic situations.<sup>5</sup> 

### Refractive correction (Spectacles and Contact Lenses) 
Improving your visual acuity has a significant impact on your overall performance. There are many options that someone can use to correct their refractive error, whether it be for myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism. 

Spectacles provide a simple and effective way of correcting your vision. They provide excellent clarity to vision and can be used for impact resistance (eye protection). However, it is important to consider that your field of vision through spectacles may be limited, fogging issues can occur and there are limitations with the types of frames chosen. 

Another important consideration is eye protection. Some sports have a much higher risk of eye injuries compared to others and hence, appropriate eye protection should be worn. They include squash, badminton, baseball, cricket and tennis. Examples of low-risk sports include athletics and cycling. 

Contact lenses are a popular choice amongst athletes as they allow for excellent field of view and clarity of vision. Innovative Eye Care offers numerous types of contact lenses which can suit athletes with small or even high or challenging refractive errors. These include soft disposable contact lenses, rigid gas permeable lenses, scleral lenses, and orthokeratology lenses. Side effects including fluctuating vision or dry eye symptoms (particularly with exercise related dehydration) are important to consider when using contact lenses. 

 

Refractive laser surgery performed by an ophthalmologist (e.g. LASIK) is another option for patients who struggle with contact lenses or want a more permanent option to correct their vision. It is important to discuss with your optometrist whether you would be a candidate and the possible risks of post-surgical complications related to your sport.  

### Vision training and Vivid Vision 

Vision training involves a series of activities which are individually prescribed to develop or improve a patient’s binocular visual skills. These important visual skills include accommodation (eye focusing), vergence (eye alignment), eye movements and depth perception. If an athlete has deficiency or weakness in one of these skills, improvement of these skills can improve athletic performance.  

 

Innovative Eye Care is the first practice in South Australia to exclusively offer the Vivid Vision virtual reality vision training program. Vivid Vision uses cutting-edge technology to help your eyes work together and improve your 3D vision. This is particularly relevant for athletes who wish to improve their depth perception, hand-eye coordination and binocular vision skills.
