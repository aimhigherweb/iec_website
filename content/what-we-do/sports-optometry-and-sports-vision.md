<p>In sports, the following phrases are often stated for good reason: “your eyes lead the body”, “keep your eye on the ball” and “you can’t hit what you can’t see”. Your vision makes up 80% of your total perceptual input and is the sense which has the most impact on sports performance.<sup>1</sup> Studies have shown that professional athletes in various sports have greater visual-perceptual and visual-cognitive skills. <sup>2</sup> 

The following are aspects of vision which can impact an athlete’s visual potential: 

* **Visual accuracy (acuity).** This can be measured both statically (black letters on white background) or dynamically (introducing motion). 
* **Ocular dominance.** Also known as eye preference, this relates to the eye that preferentially fixates on an object (like being left or right handed!). 
* **Eye tracking.** There are many different types of eye movements which follow an athlete to track a ball, make quick decisions and maintain balance.<sup>3</sup> Saccadic eye movements are involved in rapid scanning. vestibulo-ocular movements assist with balance and coordinate the eyes relative to the head movement. Vergence eye movements allow the eyes to track and object as it comes closer or further away (convergence and divergence). Slow pursuits relate to slow and controlled eye movements which track slow moving objects. 
* **Visual memory.** The ability to remember details (both short-term and long-term). 
* **Peripheral vision.** Used to detect the motion and movement of objects around you. Good peripheral vision can improve anticipation skills and reaction time.
* **Depth perception.** Important for catching, fine motor skills and dynamic situations.<sup>5</sup> 

### Refractive correction (Spectacles and Contact Lenses) 
Improving your visual acuity has a significant impact on your overall performance. There are many options that someone can use to correct their refractive error, whether it be for myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism. 

Spectacles provide a simple and effective way of correcting your vision. They provide excellent clarity to vision and can be used for impact resistance (eye protection). However, it is important to consider that your field of vision through spectacles may be limited, fogging issues can occur and there are limitations with the types of frames chosen.
