Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a non-invasive, high definition scan of the deeper retinal layers at the back of the eye. FAF highlights areas of metabolic stress that cannot be detected by conventional retinal cameras. 

<p>Innovative Eye Care uses this technology to take high definition images of the retina. This offers diagnostic insights into a number of retinal conditions, including macular degeneration and hereditary diseases.
