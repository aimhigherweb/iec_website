<p>Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a non-invasive, high definition scan of the deeper retinal layers at the back of the eye. FAF highlights areas of metabolic stress that cannot be detected by conventional retinal cameras. 
<p><a href="/contact/">Innovative Eye Care</a> uses the top of the range Heidelberg Blue laser autofluorescence to take high definition images of the retina. This offers diagnostic insights into a number of retinal conditions, including <a href="/what-we-do-macular-degeneration/">macular degeneration</a>
and hereditary diseases. 

#### What is FAF? 
The retina contains a metabolic indicator called lipofuscin, commonly referred to as the "wear and tear" pigment.<sup>1, 2</sup> When light of 488nm is shone onto the retina, lipofuscin fluoresces and the amount of fluorescence corresponds with the amount of lipofuscin present.<sup>1</sup> A number of hereditary and complex retinal diseases (including [macular degeneration](https://innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/macular-degeneration/) ) have characteristic increases or decreases in the amount of lipofuscin present in the retina.<sup>2, 3, 4</sup>  FAF provides detailed analysis of these conditions that allow the optometrists at Innovative Eye Care to accurately monitor your retinal health.
