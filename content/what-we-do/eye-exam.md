<p>Supported by <a href="/what-we-do/oct">cutting edge technology</a>, our Adelaide and Woodville teams work with you to provide quality eye care and vision solutions. Your initial eye test with our optometrists will take approximately 45 minutes and will include an in-depth evaluation to determine your prescription and check for any eye conditions. Please ensure you bring along any glasses or contact lenses you currently use and recent referral letters.

Our caring team will guide you through each step to ensure that you understand every aspect of the eye exam here at Innovative Eye Care. Our comprehensive consultation involves:

* <b>Personalised care</b>. A great eye care consultation starts with understanding you, your general health, eye health, vision needs and lifestyle.
* <b>Eye health</b>. We use advanced equipment like [OCT machines](/what-we-do/oct) and [retinal photography](/what-we-do/retinal-photography) to make sure you and your eyes are in good condition.
* <b>Eye focussing</b>. Measuring refraction, near vision and distance vision allows us to determine if you need correction with lenses.
* <b>Eye coordination</b>. Clear vision requires both eyes to be working together in the correct way. If your eyes are not cooperating, it can result in double vision, headaches and [learning problems](/what-we-do/childrens-vision).
* <b>Health & lifestyle</b>. Diet, exercise and lifestyle can have an enormous impact on your eyes. Discussing these aspects of your health with your optometrist is vital.
* <b>Eye medications & management</b>. When required we can arrange for medications to treat eye conditions or refer you for more specialised medical treatment.
* <b>Lens advice</b>. Not all lenses will suit every individual's needs. Some prefer [glasses](/what-we-do/glasses), while others will require [contact lenses](/what-we-do/contact-lenses). We can give recommendations on what is right for you.
