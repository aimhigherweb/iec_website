<p><p>Your child may not tell you they have a vision problem because they think the way they see is normal, and vision changes can occur undetected. Vision problems have a strong link with learning difficulties and educational outcomes. These problems can usually be managed or corrected by a series of <a href="/what-we-do/eye-exam">consultations</a> with an optometrist. Your child should receive an eye examination at least once every two years and more frequently if recommended by an optometrist. The earlier a vision problem is detected and treated, the more likely treatment will be successful.</p>

60% of children who are ‘problem learners’ have been found to suffer from undetected vision problems. Undetected vision problems are estimated to affect approximately one in four Australian children, which may contribute to learning difficulties in reading, writing, viewing a whiteboard, computer use and other classroom activities. A review undertaken as part of the National Children’s Vision Screening Project reported most children with academic or behavioural problems fail one or more visual tests. 

Vision plays a significant part in the learning process of a child and as such, there is a definite link between vision impairment and educational outcomes. Parents and teachers should watch for signs that a child may have a vision problem, including avoidance of reading and writing, lower comprehension and short attention span. These are sometimes incorrectly suspected as the outcomes of learning disabilities such as dyslexia or attention deficits, but can be caused by stress or frustration due to poor vision.

Innovative Eye Care partner with [KidsNetwork](www.kidsnetwork.com.au), which aims to raise awareness about the importance of looking after the health of children’s eyes throughout their schooling. We visit some of our local schools and screen kids for any issues that might be present, as well as explaining the fundamentals of these issues with their teachers and parents. 

We recommend that children have a full eye examination with an optometrist before starting school and regularly thereafter. Eye examinations attract a Medicare rebate and no referral is required.

Signs that may indicate your child has a vision problem include:

* Often blinking or rubbing their eyes
* Exhibiting a short attention span
* Avoidance of reading and any activity involving looking up close
* Skipping or omitting words and lines when reading
* Frequent headaches, especially around the eyes or the front of the head
* Covering or closing one eye when reading - they may not realise they are doing it!
* Tilting the head to one side
* Holding reading materials up close, sitting close to the television, etc.
* One eye noticeably turning out or in, especially when tired or stressed
* Seeing double
* Complaining of blurred vision at distance or near
* Losing place on a page when reading
* Difficulty remembering what they have read

For a full list of the signs of a vision problem, check out [this page](/what-we-do/signs-of-vision-problem-children).

Unfortunately, parents and teachers often incorrectly assume that if a child passes a school screening test, there is no vision problem. However, many school vision screenings only test for distance visual acuity. A child who can see small print in the distance can still have a vision problem. In reality, the vision skills needed for successful reading and learning are much more complex. 

Even if a child passes a school vision screening test, they should receive a comprehensive optometric examination if:

* They show any of the signs or symptoms of a vision problem listed above
* They are not fulfilling their potential at school
* They are able to achieve at school, but have to use excessive time and effort to do so

## New Information

Innovative Eye Care has optometrists at both our Adelaide and Woodville practices which are passionate about improving children’s vision and providing high quality paediatric eye care.

During the early stages of life, the visual system undergoes rapid changes and is the dominant sense which leads to development of perceptual, cognitive and social skills.<sup>1</sup> Many vision problems encountered by children are asymptomatic or difficult to recognise.<sup>2</sup> A study in 2002 showed that around 25% of primary school-aged children have some form of ocular codition.<sup>1</sup> Presently, this number may actually be higher due environmental and lifestyle changes.<sup>3</sup> For example with increased urbanisation, less time spent outdoors, increased use of screen-based technology (such as phones and tablets) and increased near vision tasks in younger children has lead to a rising number of short-sightedness in children.<sup>4-6</sup> Importantly, undiagnosed visual problems in children can cause development, social and academic challenges.<sup>7</sup> 

Signs that may indicate that your child has a visual problem include:

* Complaining of blurred vision at distance or when reading up close
* Seeing double
* Words moving on a page
* Frequent headaches, especially around the eyes or front of head
* Moving close to page when reading or writing
* Avoidance of near work tasks
* Missing or omitting words or lines when reading
* Reduced attention and distractibility
* Eyes turning in or out (especially when reading)
* Excessive eye rubbing

Most schools in Australia offer a form of vision screening which are great tools to detect visual problems. However, most school screenings perform a limited assessment of a child’s visual system such as visual acuity.

The goals of paediatric optometry at Innovative Eye Care are to:

* Assess the functional status of both eyes and visual system in relation to the specific level of development of the child
* Evaluate the child’s ocular health and any other related health conditions
* Educate and counsel parents/caregivers regarding their child's visual health and formulate recommendations regarding treatment, management or prevention.

A comprehensive eye examination at Innovative Eye Care will assess not only visual acuity but a wide range of components of the visual system including assessment of:

* Eye focusing strength and flexibility
* Eye tracking and movement
* Eye alignment
* Colour vision assessment
* Ocular prescription
* Eye health using [advanced imaging technology](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/oct)

Furthermore, we have tools available to detect and treat common visual problems such as:

* Short-sightedness or myopia
* [Amblyopia](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/amblyopia)
* Binocular vision problems including eye focusing, turning and tracking and treat with [vision therapy](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/vision-training)
* Strabismus
