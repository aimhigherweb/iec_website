Innovative Eye Care has optometrists at both our Adelaide and Woodville practices which are passionate about improving children’s vision and providing high quality paediatric eye care.

During the early stages of life, the visual system undergoes rapid changes and is the dominant sense which leads to development of perceptual, cognitive and social skills.<sup>1</sup> Many vision problems encountered by children are asymptomatic or difficult to recognise.<sup>2</sup> A study in 2002 showed that around 25% of primary school-aged children have some form of ocular condition.<sup>1</sup> Presently, this number may actually be higher due environmental and lifestyle changes.<sup>3</sup> For example with increased urbanisation, less time spent outdoors, increased use of screen-based technology (such as phones and tablets) and increased near vision tasks in younger children has lead to a rising number of shortsightedness in children.<sup>4-6</sup> Importantly, un-diagnosed visual problems in children can cause development, social and academic challenges.<sup>7</sup>

Signs that may indicate that your child has a visual problem include:

* Complaining of blurred vision at distance or when reading up close
* Seeing double
* Words moving on a page
* Frequent headaches, especially around the eyes or front of head
* Moving close to page when reading or writing
* Avoidance of near work tasks
* Missing or omitting words or lines when reading
* Reduced attention and distractibility
* Eyes turning in or out (especially when reading)
* Excessive eye rubbing

Most schools in Australia offer a form of vision screening which are great tools to detect visual problems. However, most school screenings perform a limited assessment of a child’s visual system such as visual acuity.

The goals of paediatric optometry at Innovative Eye Care are to:

* Assess the functional status of both eyes and visual system in relation to the specific level of development of the child
* Evaluate the child’s ocular health and any other related health conditions
* Educate and counsel parents/caregivers regarding their child's visual health and formulate recommendations regarding treatment, management or prevention.

A comprehensive eye examination at Innovative Eye Care will assess not only visual acuity but a wide range of components of the visual system including assessment of:

* Eye focusing strength and flexibility
* Eye tracking and movement
* Eye alignment
* Colour vision assessment
* Ocular prescription
* Eye health using [advanced imaging technology](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/oct)

Furthermore, we have tools available to detect and treat common visual problems such as:

* Shortsightedness or myopia
* [Amblyopia](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/amblyopia)
* Binocular vision problems including eye focusing, turning and tracking and treat with [vision therapy](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/vision-training)
* Strabismus
