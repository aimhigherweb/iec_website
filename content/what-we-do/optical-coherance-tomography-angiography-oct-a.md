<p>Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is a non-invasive scan that creates a three-dimensional image of the ocular vasculature by tracking individual blood cells in the eye. 
<p>OCT-A gives insight into microvascular changes before they even occur, making it particularly useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of retinal eye diseases, including <a href="/what-we-do/glaucoma/">glaucoma</a>, <a href="/what-we-do-macular-degeneration/">macular degeneration</a>, choroidal neovascularization, <a href="/what-we-do/diabetes-and-the-eye/">diabetes</a>, vein occlusions and optic neuropathies.<sup>1,2,3</sup> 
  
<p>The optometrists at <a href="/contact/">Innovative Eye Care</a> use the top of the range Heidelberg Spectralis OCT-A to obtain high-quality, precision images at high speeds. 

#### How does OCT-A work?

Conventional OCT scans analyze the intensity pattern of reflected light from the retina in order to assess the anatomical structure. When multiple OCT scans are taken of the same location, changes in the reflection pattern over time can be analyzed to produce the OCT-A scan. When considering the principle, that the only moving object within the retina are the individual blood cells within the vasculature, this scan then allows analysis of the flow within the retinal and choroidal blood vessels.

#### OCT-A in Glaucoma

Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that causes gradual optic nerve damage over time. In the early stages, no vision loss is noticed by the patient. Due to the insidious nature of glaucoma, it is difficult to detect and diagnose in the very early stages with conventional imaging.

Recent evidence has shown there is a strong link between the ocular vasculature and glaucoma.<sup>2,3</sup> The vascular perfusion and blood flow density within superficial retinal vessels has been found to be significantly decreased in glaucomatous eyes, when compared to healthy eyes.<sup>4</sup> This difference is noted prior to any vision loss occurs and may be used to differentiate between healthy eyes and those with pre-perimetric glaucoma (i.e. structural glaucomatous changes have occurred without causing a measurable visual defect).<sup>5</sup>  

By analyzing the blood vessels with the high definition OCT-A scans in combination with conventional OCT, we can detect glaucoma and monitor the risk of glaucoma development much earlier and with greater accuracy.<sup>2, 3, 4, 5</sup>
