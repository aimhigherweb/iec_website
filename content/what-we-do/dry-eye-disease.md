<div class="employee-heading">
<p><p>Dry eye is a broad term that covers a spectrum of specific conditions and used to describe the eye's inability to maintain healthy lubrication and can be a debilitating condition. As a result of poor lubrication, the cornea and conjunctiva become inflamed and irritated. Symptoms include dry, stinging, burning eyes, inflammation, irritation and redness, excessive tearing and foreign body sensation. This can be extremely debilitating in the day-to-day lives of sufferers. Left untreated, there is a risk of permanent damage to the ocular surface and eyelids.

The underlying causes of dry eyes are complex and numerous and need a thorough <a href="/what-we-do/eye-exam">examination</a> for your optometrist to determine the cause and most appropriate treatment. At our Adelaide and Woodville branches our therapeutic optometrists are equipped with the technology to appropriately diagnose and treat dry eye disease. </p>

### What causes dry eye disease?

The tear film is made up of three elements:the mucin (mucous) layer, the  watery aqueous layer and the oily lipid layer . <sup>1</sup> Specialised cells (such as  **goblet cells**) embedded throughout the surface of the eye create the **mucin  component**. The **lacrimal gland** under the bony aspect of the eyebrow  secretes the watery **aqueous component**. The **meibomian glands** in the  upper and lower eyelids secrete oil to make up the **lipid component**.

In most dry eye cases, the watery aqueous component is produced at normal quantities but evaporates too  quickly. This is called **evaporative dry eye**. There are three main causes: **blepharitis, meibomian gland  dysfunction** and **environmental factors**. <sup>1</sup>

* **Blepharitis** is inflammation of the eyelid margins. This is a chronic condition that arises from overpopulation of bacteria or mites (Demodex) along the eyelid margin and within eyelash follicles. 
* **Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)** is when the oil-producing meibomian glands stop working properly. This diminishes the lipid layer of the tear film, causing tears to evaporate too quickly.
* **Environmental factors** such as air conditioning, extended screen time or wind can result in excessive tear evaporation, leading to dryness and irritation.

Severe cases of dry eye are due to low production of aqueous tears, referred to as aqueous deficient dry eye.  This is less common than evaporative dry eye, and may be due to autoimmune disease, dehydration, poor sleep,  medication or prior eye surgery. <sup>1</sup>

### Treatments and Care

**Dry eye disease *can* be treated**. Lubricating eye drops are helpful but are ineffective on their own for the most cases. Dry eye disease is best treated with a **comprehensive**, **step wise**, **management system** <sup>2</sup> which involves restoring proper function to meibomian glands, maintaining good eyelid hygiene, protecting the eyes, *and* using lubricants.

#### STEP 1 

##### Lifestyle changes

**Adequate water intake and sleep**. Chronic dehydration or poor quality sleep most certainly causes dry eyes  and depending on the circumstances, may be relatively easy to address. <sup>1</sup>

**Minimise environmental triggers.** Screen use is the biggest external factor on dry eyes. People stare more and blink less when concentrating, particularly when looking at screens so reducing unnecessary screen time, taking regular short breaks or even just being conscious of staring can reduce dry eye symptoms. Also, if appropriate, minimising drying medications, use of air conditioning or forced air heating, alcohol intake and ceasing smoking can be helpful​.<sup>1</sup> Commercially available air humidifier devices may also offer relief.

##### Lubricants: Hylo Fresh/ Hylo Forte/ Thera Tears/ Tears Again Spray

**Lubricating drops replenish the deficient tear film and are a fundamental component of dry eye disease  management.** There are many eye drops with varied ingredients and your optometrist will discuss the best option for you. **Preservative free** drops are essential to avoid further aggravation of the inflamed ocular surface. Often just switching to a preservative free lubricating drop can make a dramatic difference.

##### Omega 3 Supplements

**These are only beneficial for individuals that don’t get enough omega 3 in their diet** which typically means less than 2 serves of fish a week. In these cases ~1200mg/day of high quality fish oil can improve the quality of oil produced by the meibomian glands. <sup>4</sup>

##### Warm Compresses 

**A warm compress helps to clear blocked meibomian glands by liquefying the thickened oil inside.** The glands need to be heated to only 40-50 degrees but for a full 10 mins <sup>5</sup>​, followed by 1 minute of blink training. Performed regularly, this process helps to maintain regular function of the glands for an adequate protective lipid layer.

##### Blink Training 

**Proper blinking keeps your tears healthy by spreading tears and releasing oil from eyelid glands into the tears.** Blink training, described on the last page, both promotes more complete blinks and also maximises the effect of warm compresses.

##### Optimel Manuka Honey 

**Medical grade manuka honey is antibacterial, reduces swelling and promotes healing** and these qualities make it useful in treating meibomian gland disease. <sup>6</sup> It is easy to use but honey is mildly acidic which may cause temporary stinging on application - it doesn’t cause harm to the eyes on application.

##### Glasses and Sunglasses 

Sunglasses are crucial for the health of everyone's eyes but are particularly helpful
protecting dry eyes from the harsh effects of wind. Clear glasses can be helpful for the
same reason to protect from air conditioning even when no prescription is required.

Fortunately, dry eye disease can be treated. With appropriate care, comfortable and well-lubricated eyes can be achieved, restoring quality of life. Lubricating eye drops alone are not an effective treatment for the majority of cases. Dry eye disease is best treated with a comprehensive, stepwise, management system which involves restoring proper function to meibomian glands, maintaining good eyelid hygiene, protecting the eyes, and using lubricants. 

Step 1

Lubricants: Hylo Fresh / Hylo Forte / Thera Tears / Tears Again / Genteal Gel / VitaPos

Lubricating drops replenish the deficient tear film and are an essential component of dry eye disease management. Most dry eye disease patients will always need to use some form of ocular lubricant for comfort and eye health. <b>Lubricant eye drops.</b> These can have a baffling range of ingredients, but all add to the deficient tear film. Preservative free options such as [Hylo-Fresh ](http://eyesolutions.com.au/collections/dry-eye-treatments/products/hylo-fresh)and [Hylo-Forte](http://eyesolutions.com.au/collections/dry-eye-treatments/products/hylo-forte) are best since the preservatives in multi-use eye drop bottles can further aggravate the inflamed ocular surface. Thicker drops, gels or ointments may be used for more severe dry eye or at night during sleep. Your optometrist will advise which drops are best for your eyes. Most dry eye patients will always need to use some form of ocular lubricant throughout the day for comfort. 

Omega-3 Supplements

<b>Nutritional modifications to include higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.</b> Only beneficial for individuals with low dietary omega-3, supplementation improves the quality of oil produced by oil glands in the eyelids.\ Visit our page on nutrition and eye health [here](/patient-resources/nutrition-and-supplements-for-age-related-macular-degeneration).

Heat and Massage

A warm compress helps to clear blocked meibomian glands by liquefying the thickened oil inside. The glands need to be heated to 40-50 degrees for 10 mins, followed by 1 minute of blink training. Performed regularly, this process helps to maintain regular function of the glands for an adequate protective lipid layer.

Blink Training

Proper blinking keeps your tears healthy by spreading tears and releasing oil from eyelid glands into the tears. Blink training, which is described on the last page, both promotes more complete blinks and also maximises the effect of warm compresses. There is also a free blink training app: https://apps.apple.com/au/app/donald-korb-blink-training/id941412795

Manuka Honey

Medical grade manuka honey is antibacterial, reduces swelling and promotes healing and these qualities make it useful in treating meibomian gland disease.  It is quick and easy to use but honey is mildly acidic - which doesn’t cause damage to the eyes - but may cause temporary stinging and redness on application.

Sunglasses

Sunglasses are crucial for all of us to wear, but have even more benefits for those with dry eye disease. Along with sun protection, sunglasses keep eyes sheltered from the drying effects of the wind and other irritants.

Step 2

Eyelid Hygiene

The eyelids often don’t get washed well enough since no one likes getting soap in the eyes. But good eyelid hygiene is an important way of managing dry eye disease. Antibacterial lid foams or washes cleanse the eyelids and lashes while conditioning the skin around the eyes without any stinging or irritation. 

Blephex

For more severely irritated eyelids we can perform an in-clinic microdermabrasion with the Blephex device, an electronic brush that comprehensively cleans and renews eyelid skin.

IPL

Innovative Eye Care is the first practice in South Australia to offer Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) treatments for dry eye disease! IPL technology generates an intense pulsed light directed at the lower eyelid, reducing inflammation and stimulating the meibomian glands to return to their normal function. Four treatments are recommended to best manage MGD. These are performed over a 10 week period. 

Punctal Plugs

The tear system normally functions by constantly producing tears that wash across the eye to keep it clean and comfortable and drain into a duct through the lower eyelid into the nose. It’s why your nose runs when you cry. So when tear production is low, dissolvable or non-dissolvable but removable plugs can be placed into the duct opening to improve dry eye symptoms and reduced reliance on lubricant drops.

Anti Inflammatories

Inflammation and dry eyes, like the chicken or the egg metaphor, are in a vicious cycle where one causes the other and we often don’t know which came first. Prescription anti-inflammatory drops are used in some cases to break the cycle and allow other therapies to work.

Inner Eyelid Irritation: Lomide / Cromo-Fresh

Without a nice tear layer for the eyelids to glide over they can cause friction on the eye and subsequent inflammation similar to allergy and so anti-allergy drops can be used.

Oral Medications

Low dose antibiotic tablets prescribed in conjunction with your GP can be effective in controlling the deeper inflammation within the meibomian glands.

Step 3

Secretagogues  

Prescription eye drops that stimulate production of primarily the water part of the tears

Autologous/allogeneic serum eye drops  

Eye drops with healing properties made from the serum of a person's own blood is available in SA through the public hospital system.

Therapeutic contact lens options: Soft bandage lenses or Rigid [scleral contact lenses](/what-we-do/scleral-contact-lenses)

Contact lenses are able to protect the surface of dry eyes by acting like a bandage and keeping a constant layer of tears on the surface of the eye during wear.

Step 4

Steroid eye drops  

In severe dry eye disease, inflammation is the primary problem and strong prescription anti-inflammatory eye drops 

Surgery

Blink Training

Meibomian glands, found in your upper and lower eyelids, produce oil (lipids) that are essential to eye health. But the eyes require adequate blinks to express oil from the meibomian glands. The lipid layer is the front line of defence for the eye and ocular surface. Having a lipid layer over the eye stabilizes the tear film, which is essential to clear vision and comfort. Proactive patients in combination with warm compresses, will see results. Blinking exercises will result in reduced eye discomfort and improved ocular surface health. Impress your optometrist by being diligent; do your exercises as prescribed and improvements should be evident at your next appointment.

What else can I do?

Think blink! Consider your environment and the times of day you find your eyes most uncomfortable. For example: pay attention to blinking when working on a computer or smartphone or take a moment to do your blink exercises if you start to experience discomfort.
