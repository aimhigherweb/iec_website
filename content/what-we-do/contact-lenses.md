<p><p>Contact lenses are an alternative option to spectacles for correcting vision and can offer clear vision for an array of eye conditions. At our Adelaide and Woodville branches, an optometrist can advise you on whether contact lenses are right for you.

CAPTION: A soft lens, an orthokeratology lens, and a scleral lens

#### Soft disposable lenses

There are several different types of disposable (frequent replacement) lenses.

##### Daily replacement lenses (lenses that are new with each use and discarded after wear)

#### Rigid Gas Permeable Lenses (RGP)

RGP lenses are made from a stiffer material and do not drape on the eyes like soft lenses do. Because of this, careful fitting is required. Rigid lenses are generally reserved for extreme prescriptions or precision fits, such as scleral lenses for keratoconus. [Orthokeratology](/what-we-do/orthokeratology-corneal-reshaping) lenses are a form of these hard lenses. Innovative Eye Care practitioners have had a keen interest in rigid lens fitting for a number of years and use a pioneering lens design software called EyeSpace to custom-design every hard lens used in the practice. Learn about proper care of RGP lenses [here](/patient-resources/care-of-gas-permeable-lenses).

#### Orthokeratology Lenses

[Orthokeratology](/what-we-do/orthokeratology-corneal-reshaping) (ortho-K for short) is an exciting new treatment in vision correction now available to our patients, eliminating the need to wear contact lenses or spectacles to see clearly during the day. Ortho-K vision correction works by gently reshaping the centre of the cornea overnight with custom designed contact lenses. Technically speaking, these lenses use the hydrostatic forces of you own tear-film underneath the lens to redistribute the epithelial cells on the eye’s surface. Essentially this means that once the lenses are removed in the morning, you will have clear vision without the need for any spectacles or contact lenses. Ortho-K can treat mild to moderate [myopia](/what-we-do/myopia) (short-sightedness), mild [hyperopia](/what-we-do/hyperopia) (long-sightedness), mild [astigmatism](/what-we-do/astigmatism) and even [presbyopia](/what-we-do/presbyopia). The ortho-K vision correction process is completely reversible. It has recently been shown to reduce the progression of short-sightedness in younger patients. Learn about proper care of ortho-K lenses [here](/patient-resources/care-of-orthokeratology-lenses).

#### Cost

The costs of being fitted into contact lenses varies depending on the type of lens used and the complexity of the fitting process. Careful fitting of all contact lenses is required to offer the clearest and most comfortable vision without compromising the health of the eye. 

In most cases patients with high prescriptions, different prescriptions between the eyes or irregular prescriptions (like keratoconus) may have the majority of the costs of their contact lens fitting consultations covered by Medicare. In patients that do not meet this criteria there is a fitting charge of $150 for standard cases and refits, and $180 for complex cases. This includes the appointments to teach you how to use the lenses, aftercare appointments to ensure the lenses are fitting well over time, and any trial lens required to get the fit correct. 

In most contact lens fits we use technology such as [corneal topography](/what-we-do/corneal-topography) and [OCT scans](/what-we-do/oct) to perfect the fit of our lenses. Medicare does not provide benefits for these additional tests and the use of this equipment will carry a small additional charge (children and pension/health care card holders get 50% off).

Daily replacement soft lenses tend to be priced at just over $100 for a 3 month supply per eye. A monthly replacement soft lens is about 2/3rd of this cost for the same 3 month period per eye, but does require cleaning solutions, is less convenient and carries a higher risk of infection than a daily replacement lens. More complex soft lens types like toric lenses to correct astigmatism, or [multifocal lenses for patients with presbyopia](/what-we-do/contact-lenses-for-presbyopia) will be more expensive than a standard lens.

Rigid lenses (including orthokeratology lenses) cost $350-$450 each depending on the complexity of the design. Scleral lenses are more difficult to manufacure and cost $600 each. Don't forget these lenses last 1-2 years on average. Back-up lenses of identical parameters can be ordered at half price within 12 months of the original order.
