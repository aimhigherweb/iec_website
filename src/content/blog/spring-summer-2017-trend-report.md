“Your frame says a lot about your personality, we want you to be confident, look sensational and smile radiantly when you put them on”. I always look forward to summer because I confess I really dislike the cold weather. 

Spring enthuses us with an abundant flush of colour and a celebrated long awaited warmth, not forgetting that the Spring racing carnival and the festive party season kicks off in November. For those that have private health insurance, the majority of optical benefits expire at the end of the calendar year. So, there’s absolutely no better time of the year to consider a new pair of glasses.

Whether you prefer a minimalistic look, a bold statement or an eclectic uniqueness, we have something that will be just right for you. Sheralyn and I love sharing with you the enjoyment of  this experience and take immeasurable pride in knowing that we have taken the time to pair you with the perfect frame. Your own personal eyewear collection should complement your fashion style and accessories. Ladies, consider that we never have just one pair of shoes or a single handbag. Australians are slowly catching up with the Europeans, who would never halt at just one pair of glasses. Think lifestyle!  Are you corporate throughout the week and love getting casual on the weekend? Whether it’s a lazy weekend catch up with friends and family, an elegant soiree, an evening at the theatre or cheering on your favourite team, does just one pair of glasses suit all of these occasions? 

We curate our collection for a range that meets your needs and aesthetics. We source global brands that emulate craftsmanship, quality and style. Ask us about LINDBERG if you have a connoisseur’s appreciation of exceptional design and high quality materials, Face a Face if you have a penchant for wearable art and Prodesign if you are looking for casual understated elegance. 

We gratefully acknowledge the LINDBERG craftsmen by presenting you with the following images featuring 2017 colour and style trends.
