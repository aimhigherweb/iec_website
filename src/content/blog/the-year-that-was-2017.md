As the working year has quickly come to an end, we have been reflecting on the year that was. Here are a few highlights...

We kicked off 2017 with some major renovations to the Hutt Street Practice. Thank you to all those who endured the madness during this time! In March we also said farewell to much loved Optometrist Kevin Rooney as he ventured into Retirement.

Millie also joined our support team in March who is currently in her first year of optometry at Flinders. She has brought a bundle of energy and laughs into the Practice.

After saying farewell to Kevin Rooney, we were joined by a fresh new face, Optometrist Joanna Rohrlach. Joanna enjoys practicing all aspects of optometry and has also completed further training in behavioural optometry and vision therapy under The Optometric Extension Program Foundation. We are looking forward to seeing Jo get married early 2018!

In May our optometrist Lachlan Hoy jetted off to South Africa to lecture on all things contact lenses. Meanwhile Sally, another fresh new face, joined our support team at the Hutt Street practice, having had prior experience working in quality independent Optometry practices. At the end of May we got some exciting news, our Vision Therapist Rene Mussared had her beautiful Baby girl Elilijah.

In July a few of our team members, Lachie, Jane, Georgia and Charmaine attended the ODMA conference in Sydney. This was a fantastic opportunity to network with others in the industry, share ideas and learn about all the latest technologies and products available to help our Practice evolve.

August was another busy month; Sally moved to our Henley Beach practice full time to join Pete. While Christine was turned into bionic woman, getting a brand new knee. Jasmine joined our support team full time at Hutt Street. She has always had a passion for the health industry and has worked with kids with special needs. We also received some more exciting news when Katrina and husband Mark announced the arrival of their gorgeous baby girl, Indianna.

In October we saw practice owner, Lachie, and manager of Innovative Eye Care, Georgia, tie the knot in the Adelaide Hills. They jetted off shortly afterwards on their honeymoon to Seminyak, Bali for some much needed rest and relaxation.

We were excited to have Christine back in November after her recovery. She has now found a new home at our Hutt Street Practice. November also marked 10 years since Lachie joined Ron Fieldhouse and Associates, what a milestone!

Thank you to all our loyal patients and amazing staff for your continued support throughout the 2017. We are excited for another new year of opportunities and adventure. Have a safe and happy Christmas! We look forward to seeing you in the new year.
