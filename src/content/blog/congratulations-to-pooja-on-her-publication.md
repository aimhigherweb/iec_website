We’re extremely proud of our optometrist Pooja Bhindi, who recently had her research (developed at Flinders University with a team of colleagues) published in the renowned scientific journal <i>Clinical and Experimental Optometry</i>. Pooja’s research centres around a fast-developing technology we are equipped with at our Adelaide branch – optical coherence tomography angiography, or [OCT-A](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/optical-coherance-tomography-angiography-oct-a).

For those of you who have visited our practice before, you may remember having scans of the back of your eye taken. This was performed using our state-of-the-art [Heidelberg Spectralis](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/oct), which is equipped with software that lets us track the movement of blood cells in the vessels of the eye. Pooja's paper found numerous studies concluded OCT-A's efficacy in assisting us with early detection, monitoring and managing certain eye conditions that cause changes to the eye’s blood flow. These changes can include the number of blood vessels, the size of blood vessels and the amount of blood flow. Conditions that cause these changes can be sight-threatening, like [glaucoma](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/glaucoma), [diabetes](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/diabetes-and-the-eye), [age-related macular degeneration](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/macular-degeneration) and pathological [myopia](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/what-we-do/myopia).

When you visit us, your optometrist will let you know if it’s necessary to have an OCT-A scan performed. If you’re interested in what this imaging can do for you, book an eye test with us (a reminder that you can now book online using [this link](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/contact)) or [contact our staff directly](https://www.innovativeeyecare.com.au/contact).
