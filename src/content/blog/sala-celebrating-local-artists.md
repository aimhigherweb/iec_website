It's August, which means the SALA festival has begun! Our practice has a legacy in the creative arts expanding over 40 years. Previous North Terrace optometrist Kevin Rooney brought over his interest in music, theatre and art during the merge with Innovative Eye Care, and his love for all things artistic has stayed with us since his departure. This year we partnered with local artist Paloma Concierta who has created a unique series of artwork that blends the landscape of Onkaparinga with images of the eye taken with our optical technology â€“ a look at the similarities between the outer and inner natural spaces.

On Saturday 4 August, we welcomed a mix of patients, friends and family to view the series.
